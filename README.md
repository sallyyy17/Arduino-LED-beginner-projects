# Arduino-LED-beginner-projects
These are arduino based projects ideal for a beginner. Consists of LED projects using digital and analog pins to help familiarize with arduino projects before taking up bigger porjects.
There are a total of 3 projects in all. A simple LED project, An LED & Push Button project and lastly, LED & Potentiometer project.
Virtual simulations of these projects can be viewed on TinkerCAD which is a good practice platform before doing the actual connections on the components. You are able to run and identify your errors beforehand. Links to those projects wil be attached.
Main components needed for these projects are ARDUINO UNO , Breadboard, Connecting wires, LED, Resistors, Push button & Potentiometer.
